Fontier for Chrome
===

**Fontier** is a Chrome extension, that helps Chrome users to change the default font size in the browser very easily.

I created this extension, because I work a lot with [responsive websites](http://viljamis.com/blog/2012/typography/), where we use relative (em) units for the content, and I needed a better and easier way to change the font size in Chrome (this setting is well hidden at the moment in the advanced settings).

##But what is it again?
Check out these screenshots to to see how **Fontier** does the magic:

##Installation
The latest stable version of the extension can be installed from the Google Web Store:
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fontier/dkbamaalakfhckcidgiigdinhcncaeae](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fontier/dkbamaalakfhckcidgiigdinhcncaeae)

If you would like to try the unpacked version of the extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone git@github.com:heartcode/fontier-chrome.git```
2. Open  [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in Chrome
3. Select the **'Developer mode'** option on the upper-right corner
2. Click the **'Load unpacked extension…'** button and select the **fontier-chrome** folder
3. The little ![](https://github.com/heartcode/fontier-chrome/raw/master/img/icon_16.png) icon should appear in the toolbar and the extension should be ready to go.

##Compatibility
**Fontier** is compatible with Chrome 22.0.1229.79 and later versions

##Issues
There is a bug in the native Chrome font size settings. After the font size is changed in **Fontier**, the user can't change the font size using the Chrome settings for some reason ([issue 1](https://github.com/heartcode/fontier-chrome/issues/1)). Hopefully in forthcoming versions of Chrome this bug will be eliminated.

If you experience any issues, please let me know using the [Github issues page](https://github.com/heartcode/fontier-chrome/issues).

##Licensing
The **Fontier** Chrome extension is an open source project and it is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/heartcode/fontier-chrome/).
